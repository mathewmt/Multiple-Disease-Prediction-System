    "# Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "User\n",
    "Disease  Prediction  using  Machine  Learning  is  the  system  that  is  used  to  predict  the  diseases  from  the symptoms which are given by the patients or any user. The system processes the symptoms provided by the user  as input  and  gives the  output as  the probability  of the  disease.  Naïve  Bayes  classifier  is used  in the prediction of the disease which is a supervised machine learning algorithm. The probability of the disease is calculated  by  the  Naïve  Bayes  algorithm.  With  an  increase  in  biomedical  and  healthcare  data,  accurate analysis  of  medical  data  benefits  early  disease  detection  and  patient  care.  By  using  linear  regression  and decision tree we are predicting diseases like Diabetes, Malaria, Jaundice, Dengue, and Tuberculosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Context of the Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of \"Disease Prediction using Machine Learning\" is important for several reasons, contributing to advancements in healthcare and disease management. Here are some key reasons why this topic is significant:\n",
    "\n",
    "Early Detection and Prevention:\n",
    "\n",
    "Disease prediction models enable the early detection of medical conditions based on symptoms or risk factors.\n",
    "Early detection is crucial for initiating timely interventions and treatments, often leading to better outcomes and increased chances of successful recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Patient Care:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive models provide healthcare professionals with valuable insights into potential health issues, allowing for personalized and targeted care plans.\n",
    "Customized treatments based on predictive analytics can enhance patient outcomes and overall healthcare quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing Healthcare Costs:\n",
    "\n",
    "Early detection and prevention can lead to a reduction in healthcare costs associated with treating advanced-stage diseases.\n",
    "Preventive measures are often more cost-effective than treating diseases in their later stages.\n",
    "Research and Development:\n",
    "\n",
    "The development and deployment of machine learning models in healthcare contribute to ongoing research and advancements in medical science.\n",
    "These models provide valuable insights that can guide future research and improve our understanding of various diseases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitation About other Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification allows you to include the decision function score in the prediction output, providing more information about the model's confidence or certainty in its prediction. Adjustments can be made based on the characteristics and capabilities of your new model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision function score is a concept commonly used in binary classification models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and some variants of logistic regression. The decision function outputs a continuous score for each sample, and this score is then used to make a prediction."

    "# Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are going to explain the existing model\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Loading:\n",
    "\n",
    "The application loads pre-trained machine learning models for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease using the pickle module. These models have been previously trained on relevant datasets to make predictions based on specific input features.\n",
    "Streamlit Sidebar and Option Menu:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Streamlit sidebar is used to provide a user-friendly navigation experience. An option menu is included to allow users to choose between different disease prediction categories: \"Diabetes Prediction,\" \"Heart Disease Prediction,\" and \"Parkinson's Prediction.\" Users can easily switch between these prediction modes.\n",
    "Diabetes Prediction Page:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user selects \"Diabetes Prediction,\" the application presents input fields related to diabetes risk factors, such as the number of pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, and others. A button is available to trigger the prediction process. Once clicked, the application uses the pre-trained diabetes model to predict whether the user is diabetic or not based on the provided input. The result is then displayed to the user.\n",
    "Heart Disease Prediction Page:\n",
    "\n",
    "For \"Heart Disease Prediction,\" the application prompts the user to input various factors related to heart health, including age, sex, chest pain types, and more. Similar to the diabetes prediction page, a button triggers the prediction process. The application utilizes the pre-trained heart disease model to predict the likelihood of the user having heart disease and displays the result accordingly.\n",
    "Parkinson's Prediction Page:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the \"Parkinson's Prediction\" section, users are asked to input voice-related features. The application then uses the pre-trained Parkinson's disease model to predict whether the user has Parkinson's disease or not. The result is presented to the user after clicking the prediction button.\n",
    "Prediction Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction process involves taking user inputs, processing them through the respective machine learning model, and obtaining a prediction outcome. The application communicates this outcome to the user, indicating the likelihood of having the specific disease based on the input features.\n",
    "Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a robust user experience, the application includes error handling. In case of any unexpected issues during the prediction process, error messages are displayed to inform the user about the problem, ensuring transparency and user awareness.\n",
    "In summary, the application provides an interactive and intuitive interface for users to input relevant health information and receive predictions for diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease. It leverages pre-trained machine learning models to make these predictions, aiming to assist users in understanding their potential health risks."

    "### The updated code brings several changes and benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Validation of Input Values:\n",
    "The code includes a try-except block to validate the input values before making predictions. It ensures that the input values are convertible to floats, addressing potential issues related to incorrect or non-numeric inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision Function Score Display:\n",
    "The code introduces the decision_function_score variable, which represents the decision function score of the prediction. This score provides additional information about the model's confidence in its prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Displaying the decision function score adds transparency to the prediction outcome. Users can now see a numerical score indicating how confident the model is in its prediction. This can be valuable for users who want more insight into the model's reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The code maintains the use of Streamlit's st.success for displaying the prediction outcome. This ensures consistency in the presentation style across different sections of the application\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes enhance the reliability of the application by validating input values, providing additional information about the model's confidence, and improving error handling. The decision function score contributes to a more transparent and informative user experience.\n"

    "# Conclusion and Future Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the updates made to the original code enhance the reliability, transparency, and user-friendliness of the Multiple Disease Prediction System. The inclusion of input validation, display of decision function scores, and improved error handling contribute to a more robust application. Users now benefit from additional insights into the model's confidence, and potential issues with input data are addressed more gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future Directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Exploration and Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "Explore and experiment with additional machine learning models beyond the existing ones (Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson's). Consider introducing new models or updating existing ones based on the latest research findings to improve overall prediction accuracy.\n",
    "Parameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct a comprehensive parameter tuning exercise for the existing models to optimize their performance. Adjust hyperparameters, such as learning rates, regularization terms, and tree depths, to identify the most effective configurations for each model.\n",
    "Feature Engineering:\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate the possibility of incorporating new features or refining existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the models. Feature engineering techniques, such as creating interaction terms or selecting more relevant features, can contribute to improved model performance"
